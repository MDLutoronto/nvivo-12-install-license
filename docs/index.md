Troubleshooting
===============

1\. Problems while attempting to use the license code saying the key isn't valid?

Please first check that you have installed NVivo 12 specifically.

* NVivo 12 is called “NVivo 12” and has a blue icon.  
<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVivo_troubleshooting1.png' | relative_url }}' alt='NVivo 12 icon in blue' title='' width='200' height='206' />
* The newer version of NVivo, which the University of Toronto does not have a license for, is called simply “NVivo” and has a grey icon.  
<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVivo_troubleshooting2.png' | relative_url }}' alt='NVivo icon in grey' title='' width='200' height='203' />

    + Also note that the new version asks you to Log into myNVivo once the program is opened. NVivo 12 does not do this.

**If you downloaded the wrong version, please go back to myNVivo and download NVivo 12\.**
